# Computer Graphic Challenges

##### Author: Oscar Valdés

This repository uses *[OpenGL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/FAQ#What_is_OpenGL?)* ( implemented with *[Glad](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Loading_Library#glad_(Multi-Language_GL/GLES/EGL/GLX/WGL_Loader-Generator))* and *[GLFW](https://www.glfw.org)* ) and *[p5.js](https://p5js.org)* ( a *JavaScript* interpretation of *[Processing](https://processing.org)* ) to accomplish 7 different graphics-related tasks.

Some of the tasks were built upon previous tasks, so they are not all in separate files. The tasks are listed below with a brief description.

**Task 1:** Make a program that, given 2 points in the format (x, y), returns a list of approximated points representing a line segment.

**Task 2:** Display the points from <u>task 1</u> in a canvas.

**[Task 3](/Challenges/LineInterpolation/):** Draw five lines using points in OpenGL, this task also counts as <u>tasks 1 & 2</u>.

**[Task 4](/Challenges/InteractivePolygons/):** Make a program that draws a solid pentagon. With every click, increase it side count and change its color randomly. After reaching twelve sides loop back to five.

**[Task 5](/Challenges/PolygonTransformations/):** Implement some polygon transformation funcitons, such as: rotation, reflection, scalation and shearing.

**[Task 6](/Challenges/BezierCurve/):** Make a program that allows the user to draw a line with the mouse and place some (movable) control points, which in turn replaces the line with a curve.

**[Task 7](/Challenges/BallAnimation/):** Make a program that first draws the trayectory of a bouncing ball, then shows a storyboard and lastly shows a looping animation.
